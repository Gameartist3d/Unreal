/* This repository is going to hold scripts for the game Martial Tournament. The GAS system as well as the Chaos system will be implemented. Since the Gameplay Ability System (GAS)
still has some limitiations in its current form, another attribute system will have to be created to handle actors that do not posses an ability system component.
